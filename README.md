# How to Win Life

## Use descriptive commit messages
Explain quickly what you've done and what it changes. Link to issues. 

Note: You can refer to Issues in commit messages using #issueNumber, e.g "Added section to ChangeManagement as per #1" and they will link automatically. A commit message such as "Resolves #1" or "Fixes #1" will automatically close the issue. 

## Log tasks and bugs as issues

Label, assign and use milestones properly

## Use git properly

    $ git status
You can use this to work out what state you working directory is in. It will show you've changed that you haven't added, what's been added but not committed, and in what state your working directory is in compared to master.

Remeber to do this in order to pull down other peoples changes.

Remember to use branches! A branch should be created for each feature. All code on the master branch should be deployable at any time.
