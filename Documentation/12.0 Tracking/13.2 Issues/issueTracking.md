# Issue Tracking

We will be using the GitHub Issue Tracking module in order to keep track of all tasks, bugs and other issues. This allows us to create issues, label and organise them as well as assigning specific group members to the issue or assigning an issue to a specific milestone such as an iteration.

However, we will also be formally writing up each issue as a document every time an issue on GitHub is closed. This will allow us to have a permanent hard copy record of each issue under a specific template.
