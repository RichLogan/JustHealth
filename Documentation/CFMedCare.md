#CF MedCare

##Compatability

##Design
* The design is simplistic but not particularly appealing. The menu bar at the bottom of the screen is kept so simple that it is not immediately obvious to a new user what each of the buttons actually link to.

##Functionality
* The applications allows you to input any medication, the form of that medication and when it should be taken. The application then informs you whenever these timers run out, and allow the to be labelled and repeated.

##Ease of Use
* Requires you to specifically press on buttons, rather than the elements you are interacting with themselves. This is contrary to what people instinctively expect from a mobile application.

##Speed
* It takes a few seconds to load the user profile when you first open the application, stating no profiles are present while it does so.

##Reliability
* The application appears to be fairly reliable, with no crashing or freezing present during extended use.
