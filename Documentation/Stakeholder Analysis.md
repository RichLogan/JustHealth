# Stakeholder Analysis

There are four stakeholders for our application.

1. The primary users are people with disabilities or chronic health conditions
2. The carers of these people
3. The doctors or health professionals working with the primary users
4. The family/friends of the primary users, such as their next of kin

### Patients

The primary users of the application will be those people suffering from long term disabilities or chronic health conditions.

The application will allow them to track and monitor their condition with ease, including vital information such as appointments, medication levels/dosages and historical records.

As the main users of the application, they are our most important stakeholder group to consider.

### Carers

Carers can use the application to view and track the patients information in order to help them care for their patient as best as possible. They will also directly be using the application and are thus also considered primary stakeholders.

### Doctors
Doctors will not directly be using the application but it will indirectly affect them through the actions of their patients. If necessary they can use the information collected and shown by the application in order to provide better care for their patients. They are considered to be secondary stakeholders.

### Family/Friends
Again, family/friends will not directly be using the application themselves but, like doctors, may find the information useful in order to keep track of their loved ones health and progress.
