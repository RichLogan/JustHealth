@charlotte352 ah ok, will take a look at some point this weekend
ah sorry, its on BenDesign Rich and I were looking yesterday and had no idea why we were getting the error
@charlotte352 The button isn't implemented? When I click the update button it doesn't do anything? Is this on master?
@stephentate1  Edit Carer/Patient appointment is partly there, currently getting a expected string or buffer error. but no idea why as it is the same as update appointment for carer or patient. @stephentate1 could you please have a look?
the more i think about this i did carer display personal appointments and carer display patients appointments- @benmcgregor was this you carer add personal appointments with patients?
@charlotte352 this is what need to be checked/implemented on web. Thing to remember is that q carer should only be able to update edit/delete view appointments that they have created. The non-private appointments that the patient makes they should have read-only access.","Web
