Information Management Portal
===============================

JustHealth developed the platform with a view to create a complete product, this includes an area for administrators to manage user accounts and application settings.

The home page of the portal is shown below, from here you are able to navigate to different sections that facilitate the overall user and information management of the JustHealth application.

An administrator has the capability to manage all the application user accounts, a list of all users is shown by default when the 'Users' link is selected from the left-hand navigation pane.

For simplicity and ease-of-use, an administrator can use the search bar on this page to filter the users to view only selected accounts.

From this page, you are able to update and delete user accounts using the buttons on the right-hand side of the table.

From within the main application, carers have a restricted list of medication that they can select from when adding prescriptions. As we are aware this may not include newly released medication and the list will be ever expanding, we provide the ability to request new medication to be added by an administrator.

Users can request this by contacting the JustHealth team.

When a user chooses to deactivate their account, they are given a pre-populated list of possible reasons. Whilst they are able to select 'Other', we have given administrators the option to add more reasons to the list.

As an administrator, you are shown a number of different application statistic graphs. These can help to understand the application usage in more detail and monitor the areas that need improving.

JustHealth have a Twitter account to improve their marketing position and improve methods of communication with users. This can be monitored through the portal by selecting the 'JustHealth Twitter' link in the left-hand navigation pane.

For security and user safety, administrator accounts are only able to be registered by the JustHealth development team or an existing administrator. New accounts can be registered using the form shown below, accessed from the 'Register new admin' link in the left-hand navigation pane.

We assume that all administrators would require a certain level of basic training by the JustHealth development team, this is primarily to ensure that the warnings on the home page are adhered to.
